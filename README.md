# PiHomeAuto
This is my coursework code for my home automation project assignment I have been assigned. In here is a compilation of libraries and old code which I've re-modified to make work with the home automation system. The system runs on Python 3 on a Raspberry Pi2 and soon to be upgraded to a Pi3 for increased performance for long term running times.
